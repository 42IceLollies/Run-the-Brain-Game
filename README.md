# Run-the-Brain-Game

## Description
Run the Brain is a game that helps you learn what the different parts of the brain do. You are given a variety of situations
and you have to choose which section of the brain is best fit to help in each. There are often multiple right answers and the degree
of applicability in the situation determines the number of points you earn. This was created as a semester final for 
psychology 1-2.
