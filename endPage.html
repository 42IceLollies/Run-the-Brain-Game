     <u> Descriptions of the other parts needed in the presentation:</u> <br>
      <br>
      <u> Medulla:</u> The medulla is one of the three parts of the brainstem. It regulates your heartbeat and breathing. <br>
<br>
     <u> Cerebral Cortex:</u> The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of the brain consisting of the four main lobes: parietal, occipital, temporal, <br>
      and frontal. It is the newest section of the brain evolution-wise, giving humans higher reasoning and processing abilities and unique <br>
      personalities.
<br>
<br>
     <u> Limbic System:</u> The limbic system is deeper inside the brain, older than the cerebral cortex but also younger than the Old Brain. It <br>
      consists of the amygdala, hippocampus and hypothalamus, giving you rudimentary emotions, the ability to learn and store memories and it has<br>
      control of your endocrine system to release horomones. <br>
 <br>
     <u> Corpus Callosum:</u> The corpus callosum is the connective material between the two halves of your brain. It allows communication between <br>
      the left side that thinks rationally, processing and applying logic to your experience of the world and the less linear, more feeling <br>right side which gives you imagination and intuition. <br>
