      You're in charge of the brain! <br>
    Help this person get through <br>
    several situations by activating<br>
     the correct parts of their brain. <br>
     If you select a section with a <br>
     function that may help, you get to<br>
    roll a die to earn points. If you <br>
    pick a part of the brain better <br>
    equiped to help in the situation,<br>
    you get more points. Even if<br>
    you pick the right answer, though, <br>
    you may not succeed. <br>
   At the end of the game, you'll <br>
   get scored on both the number of correct<br>
   choices and the number of points you got <br>
   from rolling the die.<br>
    Now go forth and good luck!
